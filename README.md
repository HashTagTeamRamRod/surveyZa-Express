## API

Use this as the basis for your own API documentation. Add a new third-level
heading for your custom entities, and follow the pattern provided for the
built-in user authentication documentation.

Scripts are included in [`scripts`](scripts) to test built-in actions. Add your
own scripts to test your custom API.
